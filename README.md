# localneighborhoodCNN
A convolutional neural network built and trained on MNIST data to identify digits [0-9] and perform different kinds of analysis on. The entire setup should be local to the machine, requiring everything in a single repo download. Hence, the csv format of the data is referenced.

The motivation behind this project was to get a raw understanding of the driving force behind aritificial intelligence, neural networks. The analagous relationship between these architectural networks and what they're originally named after, further warrants an understanding of how such a brute force can provide actionable results. This codebase and the progression of commits are to understand the logic and driving force of the simple network and its limitations
